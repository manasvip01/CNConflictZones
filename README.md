# CNConflictZones
This project aims to address the challenges faced by hospitals in conflict zones where communication infrastructure is disrupted. The project proposes a peer-to-peer decentralized communication system using a UDP protocol and socket programming. The system allows hospitals to communicate, share resources, and request assistance from one another. By mapping out conflict zones and utilizing a decentralized approach, the system ensures effective communication even in the absence of a central server. The project highlights the use of hole punching technique for decentralization and acknowledges the constraints of high traffic in UDP protocols. Despite these constraints, the peer-to-peer data transfer enhances efficiency and speed. The implementation method involves establishing direct communication between clients using encryption and socket programming. The project utilizes libraries such as Socket, Threading, Random, Hashlib, and getpass() to support the functionality. The algorithm involves the creation of UDP sockets, password verification using hashing, and hole punching for peer-to-peer connections. The networking aspect utilizes low-level socket programming to establish UDP connections, enabling efficient data transmission. Security measures are implemented using the hashlib library for data integrity and authentication. The project's highlights include the reliable and decentralized communication network it creates, facilitating real-time data exchange between hospitals with low latency and enhanced privacy through encryption.
